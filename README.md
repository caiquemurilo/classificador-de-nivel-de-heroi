# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hero Level Classifier Challenge

This project was developed as part of a coding challenge proposed by **DIO (Digital Innovation One)**, focusing on the fundamentals of programming logic.

## üìù What to Use

- Variables
- Operators
- Loops
- Decision Structures

### üéØ Objective

Create a variable to store a hero's name and experience (XP) amount. Then, use a decision structure to display one of the following messages:

- If **XP** is less than 1,000 = **Iron**
- If **XP** is between 1,001 and 2,000 = **Bronze**
- If **XP** is between 2,001 and 5,000 = **Silver**
- If **XP** is between 5,001 and 7,000 = **Gold**
- If **XP** is between 7,001 and 8,000 = **Platinum**
- If **XP** is between 8,001 and 9,000 = **Ascendant**
- If **XP** is between 9,001 and 10,000 = **Immortal**
- If **XP** is 10,001 or greater = **Radiant**

### ‚û°Ô∏è Output

Finally, a message should be displayed:

"The Hero named **{name}** is at the level of **{level}**"
